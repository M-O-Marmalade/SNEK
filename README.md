# SNEK

A clone of the classic game; Snake.

To play the game, download the entire repository (.zip file), then extract all contents of "SNEK-master\SNEK\x64\Release" keeping everything as-is. Run "SNEK.exe", and enjoy!

If you are running on an x86-based system (32-bit operating system), then you might try extracting all the contents of "SNEK-master\SNEK\Release" instead, though this game is untested as of yet on x86 systems.

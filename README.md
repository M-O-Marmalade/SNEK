# SNEK

A clone of the classic game; Snake.

To play the game, download the entire repository (.zip file), then extract all contents of "SNEK-master\SNEK\Release" keeping everything as-is. Run "SNEK.exe", and enjoy!

If you are going to mess with the source code, be sure to install FMOD API, as the project is dependent on this library. The project preferences link to the default install location for FMOD, on the C: drive, for the .lib files and .h files.
